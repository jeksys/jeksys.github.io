The return type of functions that do not return normally; a type with no values.

Genious Placeholder from smart people
```
@available(*, deprecated, message: "unimplemented ")
var TODO: Never{
    fatalError("unimplemented")
}
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Fix this")
var FIXME: Void{ return }
```

##[Guard or If for optional?](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-when-to-use-guard-vs-if)

Use **if** in case the optinal value is expected and it doesn't affect function.
