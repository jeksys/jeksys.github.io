@available(*, deprecated, message: "unimplemented ")
var TODO: Never{
    fatalError("unimplemented")
}
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Fix this")

### [Guard or If for optionals?](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-when-to-use-guard-vs-if)

**Guard** if an optional variable is expected to be present for the function to execute. 

Use **if** in case the optional value is expected and it doesn't affect function.
