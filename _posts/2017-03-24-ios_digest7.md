### [Never](https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/never) - The return type of functions that do not return normally; a type with no values.


### Genious Placeholders from smart people
```
@available(*, deprecated, message: "unimplemented ")
var TODO: Never{
    fatalError("unimplemented")
}
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Fix this")
var FIXME: Void{ return }
```

### [Guard or If for optionals?](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-when-to-use-guard-vs-if)

**Guard** if an optional variable is expected to be present for the function to execute. 

Use **if** in case the optional value is expected and it doesn't affect function.
